Q:What is React?
Answer: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable
UI components that manage their own state and efficiently update when the state changes.

What is JSX?
Answer: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React. 
It allows you to write HTML elements and components in a syntax that looks similar to XML or HTML, and these can be compiled to regular JavaScript.

Explain the virtual DOM in React.
Answer: The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM elements. 
React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM. 
Changes are first made to the virtual DOM, and then React calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM, 
reducing unnecessary re-rendering.

What is a React component?
Answer: A React component is a reusable, self-contained piece of UI that can be composed together to build larger applications. 
Components can be either functional or class-based, and they manage their own state, properties, and lifecycle.

What is the difference between a functional component and a class component?
Answer: Functional components are simpler, stateless components that are purely based on input props and return rendered JSX. 
Class components, on the other hand, can manage their own local state and have access to lifecycle methods.

Explain the concept of state in React.
Answer: State in React represents the mutable data that can change over time. It is managed by the component itself and can be updated using setState(). 
When state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the updated state.

What are props in React?
Answer: Props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. 
They are immutable and provide a mechanism for components to communicate and share information.
               
What is the significance of the key attribute in React lists?
Answer: The key attribute is used to provide a stable identity to list items during rendering. 
It helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. Keys should be unique among siblings, but don't need to be globally unique.

Explain the concept of lifting state up.
Answer: Lifting state up is the process of moving the state from a child component to its parent component. 
This allows multiple child components to share the same state, ensuring consistency and making it easier to manage and update the state.

What is the significance of shouldComponentUpdate method?
Answer: shouldComponentUpdate is a lifecycle method in class components that allows the developer to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-rendering. 
By default, the method returns true, but it can be implemented to compare current and next props and state to decide if a re-render is necessary.
