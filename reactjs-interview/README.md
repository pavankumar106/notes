## Questions
1. What is server side rendering ?
```
Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique used in web development where a web server processes the request for a web page and
generates the HTML content on the server before sending it to the client's browser.

The server generates the full HTML content of a web page in response to a user's request.
The HTML is sent to the client's browser, and it includes the fully rendered content.
This approach can result in faster initial page loads because users receive a fully formed page from the server.

SSR Pros:
* Faster initial page loads: Users receive a fully rendered page from the server.
* Improved SEO: Search engines can more easily index content since it's present in the initial HTML.
* Better performance on low-powered devices or slow networks for the first page view.
