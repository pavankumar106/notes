* What is a class
```
A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) of that class.
It serves as a template or a prototype from which objects are created.
A class defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that are common to all objects of that class.
Attributes represent the state of the object, while methods represent the behavior or actions that the object can perform.
